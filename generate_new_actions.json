Each decision you make should carefully consider the individual behavior of each agent, the primary objective of each scenario, and the rules of the entire environment.\n\nScenario: Apples are spread around and can be consumed for a reward of 1. Apples that have been consumed regrow with a per-step probability that depends on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. As a consequence, a patch of apples that collectively doesn't have other apples within a distance of 2 from them, can be irrevocably lost if all apples in the patch are consumed. Therefore, agents must exercise restraint when consuming apples within a patch. Each apple tree contains multiple apples.\n\nRoles: \nThere are 1 kind of roles in this scenario : (Consumer). Each role has its own valid actions and an agent have to act according to his role.\n- Consumer role: The primary goal of a Consumer agent is to maximize their reward by efficiently collecting apples and avoiding unnecessary actions.\n\nConsiderations and constrains:\n- An agent can only attack another agent if he is at least 3 steps upward from you.\n\nRemember, the goal for each agent in this world is to maximize its rewards (gathered apples).", "agent_bio_str": "", "current_plan": "The new plan for Pedro is as follows: 1.
